Design a quantitative model to produce a risk metric for how likely we will hit recession next quarter(or next week or day?), 100% being we are so toppy.

Data from tradingview: 
ISM - USMPR
Liquidity: central bank balance sheet from US,CN, JP, UK, EU
USCBBS, CNCBBS, JPCBBS, EUCBBS, GBCBBS

Also a possibility to use tradinview charting tool, but need to use typescript/javascript.

Add option to overlay sp500 chart on all the charts.

some sort of metrics to show what percentage of the US market movement is driven by speculation vs fundamentals such as earnings vs debasement/inflation

Debt metrics? need examine the relationship between debt and market cycle. So far not seeing too much connection

market sentiment?
