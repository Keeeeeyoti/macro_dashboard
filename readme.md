The goal of this dashboard is to assess the macro landscape for US financial markets and to identify the current stages of key economic cycles. We aim to develop an effective bias to provide actionable guidance in the markets.

Design a quantitative model to produce a risk metric for how likely we will hit recession next quarter(or next week or day?), 100% being we are so toppy.
